%1$s version %2$s
Usage:
  java -jar %1$s [-n] [-l] items

This script generates a list of L random N-tuples from the items 
in the input list (assumed to be in one-keyword-per-line format).

The items are sampled with replacement. 

The tuples will not be identical (nor will they be permutations of 
each other).

Thus, the maximum number of tuples requested cannot be higher than the 
number of N-sets that can be chosen from the number of items.

N defaults to 3, L defaults to 10.
